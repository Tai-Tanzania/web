                    Storytelling has the power to entice and bring social behavioral change. This has been proven, time and again, from our forefathers and the tradition of telling tales while gathering around the fire with youngsters to the immense crowding of cinematic theatres for a showcase of play or movies. How the story is told determines how positively or negatively they impact their audience.

                    Tai Tanzania uses a unique approach to developing and delivering educational content preferring to package relevant information in the form of engaging animated stories. This is especially effective given the primary target group of young people. The use of digital animated content also lends itself well to an increasingly tech-driven society in which most people have access to mobile phones and the internet which easier to disseminate and engage a wider base of beneficiaries.
