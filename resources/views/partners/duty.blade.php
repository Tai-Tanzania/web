                            Storytelling has the power to entice and bring social behavioral change. This has been proven, time and again,<br> from our forefathers 
                             and the tradition of telling tales while gathering around the fire with youngsters to the immense <br>crowding of cinematic theatres 
                              for a showcase of play or movies. How the story is told determines how positively or negatively they impact their audience.

                              Tai Tanzania uses a unique approach to developing and delivering educational content preferring to package relevant information
                               in the form of engaging animated stories. This is especially effective given the primary target group of young people. 
                                The use of digital animated content also lends itself well to an increasingly tech-driven society in which most people 
                                 have access to mobile phones and the internet which easier to disseminate and engage a wider base of beneficiaries.

                            There are millions of youths and adults who will be able to benefit from the content we create as it would teach them about their
                             rights and how to live with one another, overcoming taboos, discrimination and any stigma around various topics
                              like menstrual health, albinism and HIV/AIDs. We hope, in five years, that our content has reached 20 million people
                              through community awareness campaigns across multiple communication channels in target areas.
