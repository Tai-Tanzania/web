                    There are millions of youths and adults who will be able to benefit from the content we create as it would teach them about their rights and how to live with one another, overcoming taboos, discrimination and any stigma around various topics like menstrual health, albinism and HIV/AIDs. We hope, in five years, that our content has reached 20 million people through community awareness campaigns across multiple communication channels in target areas.
