                            Tai Tanzania believes education to be a powerful tool in helping young people to reach their full potential.
                             In so doing, our organization focuses on ringing about socio – behavioural changes in community using storytelling
                              as an instructional and knowledge sharing modality to raise awareness on different SRH, MHH, disabilities and health challenges
                               affecting young adolescent within the community and which hiders their access to education.

                            Grounded in Human-Centered Design methodology, we employ a systematic, participatory process that utilizes
                             television, video, print, social media, interpersonal channels, and community mobilization to achieve defined objectives at the community,
                              national and regional levels.

                            This first stage involves story collection. A process which directly involves our beneficiaries.
                             Through them, we gather real stories and create real animations.
