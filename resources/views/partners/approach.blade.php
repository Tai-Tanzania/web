                            Tai Tanzania believes education to be a powerful tool in helping young people to reach their full potential.

                              as an instructional and knowledge sharing modality to raise awareness on different SRH, MHH, disabilities and health challenges
                               affecting young adolescent within the community and which hiders their access to education.
